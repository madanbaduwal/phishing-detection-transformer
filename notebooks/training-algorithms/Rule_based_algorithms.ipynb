First, you’ll need to define two lists of words that characterize each group (e.g., words related to sports such as football, basketball, LeBron James, etc., and words related to politics, such as Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Putin, etc.).\n",

    "* Next, when you want to classify a new incoming text, you’ll need to count the number of sport-related words that appear in the text and do the same for politics-related words. If the number of sports-related word appearances is greater than the politics-related word count, then the text is classified as Sports and vice versa.\n",
